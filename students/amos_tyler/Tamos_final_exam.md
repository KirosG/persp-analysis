## Independent Evaluation: Paper 1

#### Edelman and Luca, 2014. _Digital Discrimination: The Case of Airbnb.com_ 

### Summary of Research Design

(3 pts each) Summarize the research design and explain how the research design leverages computational methods to ask and answer a question.

_How does the paper use computational methods to ask and answer a question?_

### Evaluation of Research Design Effectiveness

_What do we learn from the paper?_


_What are the limitations of the paper?_

Think back to Salganik's characteristics of big data and our assessment of experiments' validity, heterogeneity of treatment effects, and causal mechanisms. Draw on these methods of assessment as you evaluate the effectiveness of each paper.


## Independent Evaluation: Paper 2

#### Edelman et al, 2017. _Racial Discrimination in the Sharing Economy: Evidence from a Field Experiment_


### Summary of Research Design

(3 pts each) Summarize the research design and explain how the research design leverages computational methods to ask and answer a question.

_How does the paper use computational methods to ask and answer a question?_

### Evaluation of Research Design Effectiveness

_What do we learn from the paper?_


_What are the limitations of the paper?_

Think back to Salganik's characteristics of big data and our assessment of experiments' validity, heterogeneity of treatment effects, and causal mechanisms. Draw on these methods of assessment as you evaluate the effectiveness of each paper.


## Joint Evaluation

### Value-added of Conducting Both Research Projects
(3 pts) Identify the value-added of conducting both research projects. That is, what do we learn from running both an observational study and a field experiment that we could not learn from just one of these methods?

### Application of a Survey Approach

_What are the potential drawbacks?_

__What can mitigate these drawbacks?__

(3 pts) Consider how you could apply a digital survey-based research design to the primary question of interest from these two papers. What are the potential drawbacks to a survey approach? How might you overcome these drawbacks?
